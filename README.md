# Hands On IoT
## About this teaching material

This course is focused on acquiring the knowledge and experiences related
to IoT technologies and applications. The aim is to introduce students
into the IoT world with modern tools along with examples and exercises
analyzing its advantages and disadvantages. The approach relies heavily in
applied problems with interaction among students through virtual and hands on
experimentation. Industry standard tools are presented in order to contrast,
compare and select the most suitable for different applications.

## Main topics
- IoT Fundamentals
- IoT Hardware
- IoT Software
- Sensors, Actuators and Peripherals
- Gateways
- Network Topologies
- Cloud Services
- Data Storage, Processing and Visualization

## What you will learn
- IoT basic concepts
- MicroPython (Python for embedded devices)
- Communication protocols used in IoT
- Connection to the physical world (sensors, actuators and peripherals)
- IoT networking (Bluetooth, WiFi, Zigbee, LoRa, Sigfox)
- Cloud computing and services

## Learning Outcome

- Experimental introduction into IoT technologies
- Understand the inner workings of IoT devices based on microcontrollers
- How to use and connect sensors, actuators and peripherals
- Develop the IoT devices firmware
- Deploy web applications and web services to the cloud

## Methodology

Distant online learning delivered live through an online platform mixed with 
face to face students simultaneously on real-time. Video tutorials and PDF
manuals with instructions for setting up tools and applications.Common access
to the needed tools through the use of a common framework. Encourage discussions
between students and teachers using a web forum. Remote domotics laboratory
available 24/7 for experimenting and exercising. A project-based learning 
(PBL) strategy is mainly used. The course is expected to be graded
with a presentation of an end-term project.
