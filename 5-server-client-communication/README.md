# Module 6: Client - Server Communication

In this module, the development kit is connected to a local network
through WiFi. MQTT client installation and configuration is done and
then used to send and receive messages between students. Also a mid-term
project is announced and consists in solving the exercise proposed
at the end of the lecture.
